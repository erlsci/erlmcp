- Streamlined build system and added Hex publishing support
- Updated minimum Erlang/OTP requirement to version 25+

## Breakdown

### Infrastructure & Build System

1. **Added Apache 2.0 License** - Full Apache 2.0 license file added to establish clear licensing terms for the project

2. **Enhanced CI Pipeline** - Updated GitHub Actions to drop OTP 24 support, now requires OTP 25 or later for better stability and modern Erlang features

3. **Project Branding** - Added project logo and enhanced README with build status badges to improve project visibility and professional appearance

4. **Hex Publishing Support** - Added `publish` target to Makefile for streamlined package publishing to the Hex package manager

5. **Build System Cleanup** - Removed ex_doc documentation generation setup and updated rebar aliases (`clean` â†’ `cleanplus`) for better build management

### Code Quality & Type Safety

6. **Comprehensive Type Specifications** - Added detailed type specs to `erlmcp_app`, `erlmcp_sup`, and `erlmcp_server` modules for better static analysis and developer experience

7. **Improved Error Handling** - Enhanced error tuple matching in `erlmcp_client` for more robust error propagation and consistent error responses

8. **OTP Compliance** - Fixed gen_server reply patterns to follow OTP best practices, improving reliability and preventing potential race conditions

9. **Transport Layer Cleanup** - Removed unused transport behavior implementations and cleaned up unused functions in HTTP and TCP transport modules

10. **Code Maintenance** - Removed unused error formatting functions from `erlmcp_json_rpc` module and improved overall code organization

### Application Metadata

11. **Version Update** - Bumped application version from 0.2.4 to 0.2.5 to reflect the accumulated improvements

12. **Enhanced File Inclusion** - Updated package files list to include config, docs, and examples directories for better package completeness

13. **Metadata Cleanup** - Removed placeholder maintainer information to avoid confusion in published packages

14. **Transport Type Definitions** - Added comprehensive `transport_opts()` type definitions for better API documentation and type checking

This release focuses on production readiness, code quality, and developer experience improvements while maintaining backward compatibility with existing applications.
