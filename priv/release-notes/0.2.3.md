# erlmcp Documentation Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the documentation refactoring for the erlmcp project, transforming verbose documentation into a concise, engaging structure.

## Main README Changes

The new README follows a clear structure:

- **Short, punchy one-liner description**: "Erlang implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDK."
- **Brief paragraph explaining what MCP enables**: Focuses on AI assistant integration and OTP compliance
- **Quick start examples**: Immediate, runnable code showing both client and server usage
- **Links to comprehensive documentation**: Points to detailed guides without cluttering the main page

## Documentation Structure

### `docs/architecture.md`

- System design overview with visual component diagram
- Core modules and their responsibilities
- Extension points for custom implementations
- Performance and security considerations

### `docs/protocol.md`

- MCP protocol implementation details
- Message formats (requests, responses, notifications)
- Core methods reference table
- Implementation examples for resources, tools, and prompts
- Best practices for protocol usage

### `docs/otp-patterns.md`

- Erlang/OTP patterns demonstrated in the codebase
- Supervision tree structures and strategies
- gen_server and gen_statem implementation patterns
- Error handling approaches (let it crash, graceful degradation, circuit breaker)
- Performance optimization patterns
- Common pitfalls and solutions

### `docs/api-reference.md`

- Complete API documentation for client and server
- Type definitions with clear specifications
- Usage examples for each major function
- Error handling reference
- Links back to working examples

## Key Improvements

### Focused Content

- **Main README**: Gets users started in under 5 minutes
- **Separate docs**: Provide depth without overwhelming newcomers
- **Clear navigation**: Each document has a specific purpose

### Better Engagement

- **Code-first approach**: Examples before explanations
- **Practical focus**: Real-world usage patterns
- **Progressive disclosure**: Basic â†’ Advanced as needed

### Reduced Redundancy

- **Single source of truth**: Each concept explained once
- **Cross-linking**: Documents reference each other appropriately
- **DRY principle**: Don't repeat yourself across documents

### Improved Examples

The examples were completely rewritten to demonstrate:

- **Weather Server**: Full OTP gen_server with MCP integration
- **Calculator Client**: gen_statem for connection management
- **MCP Application**: Complete supervised application

Each example shows idiomatic Erlang patterns rather than simplistic demonstrations.

## Benefits

1. **Faster onboarding**: Users can start using erlmcp immediately
2. **Better discoverability**: Clear document titles and purposes
3. **Maintainability**: Focused documents are easier to update
4. **Professional appearance**: Clean, organized documentation
5. **Comprehensive coverage**: Nothing lost, just better organized
