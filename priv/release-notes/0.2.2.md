# Summary of Improved Examples

The refactored examples now demonstrate proper Erlang/OTP patterns:

## 1. Weather Server (weather_server.erl)

- Full OTP gen_server with proper state management
- Comprehensive MCP implementation with resources, tools, and prompts
- Alert subscription system with thresholds
- Automatic weather simulation
- Proper error handling and logging
- Clean separation of concerns

## 2. Calculator Client (calculator_client.erl)

- gen_statem for connection state management
- Automatic reconnection with backoff
- Request queuing during connection setup
- Multiple fallback strategies for calculations
- History tracking
- Robust error handling

## 3. MCP Application (mcp_application.erl)

- Complete OTP application structure
- Proper supervision tree
- Integration test scenarios
- Demo runners
- Process monitoring

## 4. Documentation (README.md)

- Comprehensive usage examples
- Design patterns explained
- Debugging tips
- Production considerations
- Extension guide

## Key Improvements

**State Machines:** Using gen_statem for complex connection management

**Supervision:** Proper supervisor hierarchies with restart strategies

**Error Handling:** Let-it-crash philosophy with graceful degradation

**Type Safety:** Complete type specifications for Dialyzer

**Resource Management:** Clean lifecycle management with proper cleanup

**Concurrency:** Process-based architecture with message passing

**Testing:** Integration test scenarios and monitoring

**Production Ready:** Configuration, monitoring, and scaling considerations

## What These Examples Showcase

These examples now properly demonstrate:

- OTP design principles
- Fault-tolerant architecture
- Idiomatic Erlang patterns
- Real-world usage scenarios
- Production-ready code structure

The examples can be run individually or as part of the complete application, demonstrating both standalone usage and integrated systems.
